@article{Erdos1999a,
abstract = {Inferring evolutionary trees is an interesting and important problem in biology, but one that is computationally difficult as most associated optimization problems are NP-hard. Although many methods are provably statistically consistent (i.e. the probability of recovering the correct tree converges to 1 as the sequence length increases), the actual rate of convergence for different methods has not been well understood. In a recent paper we introduced a new method for reconstructing evolutionary trees called the dyadic closure method (DCM), and we showed that DCM has a very fast convergence rate. DCM runs in O(n5 log n) time, where n is the number of sequences, and so, although polynomial, the computational requirements are potentially too large to be of use in practice. In this paper we present another tree reconstruction method, the witness-antiwitness method (WAM). WAM is faster than DCM, especially on random trees, and converges to the true tree topology at the same rate as DCM. We also compare WAM to other methods used to reconstruct trees, including Neighbor Joining (possibly the most popular method among molecular biologists), and new methods introduced in the computer science literature.},

@article{Taberlet2012,
abstract = {Virtually all empirical ecological studies require species identification during data collection. DNA metabarcoding refers to the automated identification of multiple species from a single bulk sample containing entire organisms or from a single environmental sample containing degraded DNA (soil, water, faeces, etc.). It can be implemented for both modern and ancient environmental samples. The availability of next-generation sequencing platforms and the ecologists' need for high-throughput taxon identification have facilitated the emergence of DNA metabarcoding. The potential power of DNA metabarcoding as it is implemented today is limited mainly by its dependency on PCR and by the considerable investment needed to build comprehensive taxonomic reference libraries. Further developments associated with the impressive progress in DNA sequencing will eliminate the currently required DNA amplification step, and comprehensive taxonomic reference libraries composed of whole organellar genomes and repetitive ribosomal nuclear DNA can be built based on the well-curated DNA extract collections maintained by standardized barcoding initiatives. The near-term future of DNA metabarcoding has an enormous potential to boost data acquisition in biodiversity research.},

abstract = {Metabarcodingofmixed arthropodsamples forbiodiversity assessmenthas mostly been carried outonthe 454 GSFLXsequencer (Roche,Branford,Connecticut, USA), due to its ability to produce long reads (≥400 bp) that are believed to allow higher taxonomic resolution. The Illumina sequencing platforms, with their much higher throughputs, could potentially reduce sequencing costs and improve sequence quality, but the associated shorter read length (typically {\textless}150 bp) has deterred their usage in next-generation-sequencing (NGS)-based analyses of eukaryotic biodiversity, which often utilize standard barcode markers (e.g. COI, rbcL, matK, ITS)thatare hun- dredsofnucleotides long. 2. Wepresent a new Illumina-based pipeline to recover full-lengthCOIbarcodesfrommixed arthropodsamples. Our new assembly program, SOAPBarcode, a variant of the genome assembly program SOAPdenovo, uses paired-end reads of the standard COI barcode region as anchors to extract the correct pathways (sequences) out of otherwise chaotic ‘de Bruijn graphs', which are caused by the presence of large numbers of COI homologs of high sequence similarity. 3. Two bulk insect samples of known species composition have been analysed in a recently published 454 meta- barcoding study (Yu et al. 2012) and are re-analysed by our analysis pipeline. Compared to the results of Roche 454 (c. 400-bp reads), our pipeline recovered full-length COI barcodes (658 bp) and 17–31{\%}more species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from bulk insect samples, with fewer untraceable (novel) OTUs. On the other hand, our PCR-based pipeline also revealed higher rates of contamination across samples, due to the Illu- mina's increased sequencing depth.On balance, the assembled full-length barcodes and increasedOTUrecovery ratesresultedinmoreresolvedtaxonomicassignments andmoreaccuratebetadiversity estimation. 4. The HiSeq 2000 and the SOAPBarcode pipeline together can achieve more accurate biodiversity assessment at amuch reduced sequencing cost in metabarcoding analyses.However, greater precaution is needed to prevent cross-sample contamination during field preparation and laboratory operation because of greater ability to detect non-targetDNAamplicons present in low-copy numbers.

@article{Schoch2012,
abstract = {Six DNA regions were evaluated as potential DNA barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},
